Welcome to the CRUDinPHP wiki!

# Introduction

I am trying to implement a micro framework that enables me to make complex MySQL statements without working about the actual MySQL queries myself, and to be able to inject it at any future PHP projects. 

please if you have any comments tell me, any suggestions edits, I am doing this in order to improve my coding skills, so your feedbacks on what I do is all what I really care about.

## Current Features

* implemented the first and easiest query [SELECT * FROM <table_name>]

I know it sounds really silly and what is already done is nothing really, but I am hoping that one day I will get it to a level of maturity where I can use it in my web Applications, so please give me a feedback 

you can always contact me on 'belalmostafa30@gmail.com', please include in the subject CRUDinPHP
